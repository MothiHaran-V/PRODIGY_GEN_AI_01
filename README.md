🔐 Task 1 – Caesar Cipher

Internship: Cybersecurity – Prodigy Infotech


---

📄 Description

This task involves creating a Python program to implement the Caesar Cipher encryption algorithm. The program enables users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting the characters of the input text based on a user-defined shift value. The Caesar Cipher is a classical encryption technique based on character substitution.
